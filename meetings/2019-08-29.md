### Paper
- [LDAvis: A method for visualizing and interpreting topics](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W14-3110) by 
Carson Sievert and Kenneth E. Shirley. We present LDAvis, a web-based interactive
visualization of topics estimated using
Latent Dirichlet Allocation that is built using
a combination of R and D3. Our visualization
provides a global view of the topics
(and how they differ from each other),
while at the same time allowing for a deep
inspection of the terms most highly associated
with each individual topic. First,
we propose a novel method for choosing
which terms to present to a user to aid in
the task of topic interpretation, in which
we define the relevance of a term to a
topic. Second, we present results from a
user study that suggest that ranking terms
purely by their probability under a topic is
suboptimal for topic interpretation. Last,
we describe LDAvis, our visualization
system that allows users to flexibly explore
topic-term relationships using relevance to
better understand a fitted LDA model.
