  - >Programming is math and math is programming. But the kind of math that's useful in programming is not what they teach you in school. In fact it's much more interesting. Category theory seems to be esoteric when presented by mathematicians, because all their examples come from other branches of mathematics. But when you use examples from programming, things suddenly becomes quite obvious. And the reason there is such a close fit between category theory and programming is quite simple: both are built on the principle of composability.

## Advanced theory and application
- [AFOSR_Proposal--Agent_Interaction_II--2018](http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/grants/AFOSR_Proposal--Agent_Interaction_II--2018.pdf): Spivak's proposal suggesting the application of category theory on
a broad look at machine learning.

  - > We seek a mathematical framework for specifying various aspects of an autonomous
agent and its interactions with other agents, including humans. Just like linear algebra offers tools and ideas that can be used in a wide range of applications—machine
learning, statistics, differential equations, graphics processing, and so on—we need a
mathematical language and toolset that can be used to conceptualize and interrelate the
sorts of concerns that arise when considering autonomous agents and their interaction,
in all its forms.
In this proposal, we lay out a vision for using category theory to manage the interaction of various sorts of agents (including human agents), as well as the sorts of planning
and learning that makes autonomy possible
