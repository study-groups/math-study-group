# Resources for studying category theory

## Books and Papers
- [What is Applied Category Theory?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05923): Tai-Danae Bradley's paper. Start here.

## Courses
- [Programming with Categories ](http://brendanfong.com/programmingcats.html): By Brendan Fong, David Spivak and 
Bartosz Milewski.
  - > Summary: In this course we explain how category theory—a branch of mathematics known for its ability to organize the key abstractions that structure much of the mathematical universe—has become useful for writing elegant and maintainable code. In particular, we'll use examples from the Haskell programming language to motivate category-theoretic constructs, and then explain these constructs from a more abstract and inclusive viewpoint. Hands-on programming exercises will be used to demonstrate categorical ideas like "the universal property of products" in working Haskell code.
- [Abstract Algebra](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/open-learning-initiative/abstract-algebra) by Benedict Gross 
at Harvard. 
  - > Algebra is the language of modern mathematics. This course introduces students to that language through a study of groups, group actions, vector spaces, linear algebra, and the theory of fields. In these free videotaped lectures, Professor Gross presents an array of algebraic concepts.
  
## Video
- [A Crash Course in Category Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JH_Ou17_zyU): by Bartosz Milewski.
  - >Programming is math and math is programming. But the kind of math that's useful in programming is not what they teach you in school. In fact it's much more interesting. Category theory seems to be esoteric when presented by mathematicians, because all their examples come from other branches of mathematics. But when you use examples from programming, things suddenly becomes quite obvious. And the reason there is such a close fit between category theory and programming is quite simple: both are built on the principle of composability.

## Advanced theory and application
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12j8OV-ptC4](Tai-Danae Bradley: Modeling Language with Tensor Networks)
  - >Abstract: Natural language has both a compositional and a statistical structure. These structures emerge when expressions in language combine to form longer expressions, and where the validity of an expression is captured by the statistics in the language. One model for this is a monoidal functor from a category of grammar to an appropriate semantics category. Another modeling choice is to let statistics serve as a proxy for grammar, taking inspiration from quantum probability theory. This talk features the latter. I’ll share an elementary passage from classical probability to quantum probability and use it to describe a tensor network model for language.

- [AFOSR_Proposal--Agent_Interaction_II--2018](http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/grants/AFOSR_Proposal--Agent_Interaction_II--2018.pdf): Spivak's proposal suggesting the application of category theory on
a broad look at machine learning.

  - > We seek a mathematical framework for specifying various aspects of an autonomous
agent and its interactions with other agents, including humans. Just like linear algebra offers tools and ideas that can be used in a wide range of applications—machine
learning, statistics, differential equations, graphics processing, and so on—we need a
mathematical language and toolset that can be used to conceptualize and interrelate the
sorts of concerns that arise when considering autonomous agents and their interaction,
in all its forms.
In this proposal, we lay out a vision for using category theory to manage the interaction of various sorts of agents (including human agents), as well as the sorts of planning
and learning that makes autonomy possible
